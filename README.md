SIEM on Amazon OpenSearch Service is a solution for collecting multiple types of logs from multiple AWS accounts, correlating and visualizing the logs to help investigate security incidents. Deployment is easily done with the help of AWS CloudFormation or AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK), taking only about 30 minutes to complete. As soon as AWS services logs are put into a specified Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, a purpose-built AWS Lambda function automatically loads those logs into SIEM on OpenSearch Service, enabling you to view visualized logs in the dashboard and correlate multiple logs to investigate security incidents.

## Dashboard

See [this](docs/dashboard.md)

## Getting Started

In this tutorial, you will create a publicly accessible SIEM on OpenSearch Service domain using a CloudFormation template. See [Advanced Deployment](docs/deployment.md) if you need to deploy it within an Amazon VPC or need to customize it.

You can add country information as well as latitude/longitude location information to each IP address. To get location information, SIEM on OpenSearch Service downloads and uses GeoLite2 Free by [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com). If you want to add location information, get your free license from MaxMind.

Threat information can be enriched based on IP addresses and domain names (EXPERIMANTAL). Threat information sources include your own IoCs (Indicators of compromise) in TXT and STIX 2.x formats, [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org), [Abuse.ch Feodo Tracker]( https://feodotracker.abuse.ch), [AlienVault OTX](https://otx.alienvault.com/). If there are many IoCs, the processing time of Lambda will increase, so please select IoCs carefully. If you want to use the IoC on AlienVault OTX, please get your API key at [AlienVault OTX](https://otx.alienvault.com/#signup). See [Threat Information Enrichment by IoC](./docs/configure_siem.md#threat-information-enrichment-by-ioc) for more details.

> **_Note:_** The CloudFormation template will deploy OpenSearch Service with **a t3.medium.search instance. It's not the AWS Free Tier. Change it to an instance type that can deliver higher performance than t3 when using SIEM in the production environment as it requires higher processing power when aggregating many logs.** Use the AWS Management Console to change the instance type, extend the volume, or use UltraWarm. This is because the CloudFormation template for SIEM on OpenSearch Service is designed for the initial deployment purpose only, and cannot be used for management purposes like changing/deleting nodes.

### 1. Quick Start

Choose a region where you want to deploy SIEM on OpenSearch Service from the following. If there is no region below, please check [CloudFormation Template For All Regions](docs/cloudformation_list.md).

| Region | CloudFormation | Template URL |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| US East (N. Virginia)<br>us-east-1 |[![Deploy in us-east-1](./docs/images/cloudformation-launch-stack-button.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=siem&templateURL=https://aes-siem-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/siem-on-amazon-opensearch-service.template) | `https://aes-siem-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/siem-on-amazon-opensearch-service.template` |

Or you can create your own template by the [steps](./docs/configure_siem.md#creating-a-cloudFormation-template).

### 2. Configuring OpenSearch Dashboards

It will take about 30 mins for the deployment of SIEM on OpenSearch Service to complete. You can then continue to configure OpenSearch Dashboards.

1. Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console, choose the stack that you've just created, and then choose "Outputs" from the tab menu at the top right. You can find your username, password, and URL for OpenSearch Dashboards. Log into OpenSearch Dashboards using the credentials.
1. When you login for the first time, [Select your tenant] is displayed. Select [**Global**]. You can use the prepared dashboard etc.
1. You can also select [**Private**] instead of [Global] in [Select your tenant] and customize configuration and dashboard etc. for each user. The following is the procedure for each user. If you select Global, you do not need to set it.
    1. To import OpenSearch Dashboards' configuration files such as dashboard, download [saved_objects.zip](https://aes-siem.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/saved_objects.zip). Then unzip the file.
    1. Navigate to the OpenSearch Dashboards console. Click on "Stack Management" in the left pane, then choose "Saved Objects" --> "Import" --> "Import". Choose dashboard.ndjson which is contained in the unzipped folder. Then log out and log in again so that the imported configurations take effect.

### 3. Loading logs into OpenSearch Service

All you need to do to load logs into SIEM on OpenSearch Service is PUT logs to the S3 Bucket named **aes-siem-<YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT>-log**. Then the logs will be automatically loaded into SIEM on OpenSearch Service. See [this](docs/configure_aws_service.md) for detailed instructions on how to output AWS services logs to the S3 bucket.

## Workshop

We have published the workshop, [SIEM on Amazon OpenSearch Service Workshop](https://security-log-analysis-platform.workshop.aws/en/). In this workshop, we will build the SIEM, ingest AWS resource logs, learn OpenSearch Dashboards, investigate security incident, create dashboard, configure alerts and ingest logs of Apache HTTPD server.

## Updating SIEM

If you want to update "SIEM on OpenSearch Service" to the latest version, upgrade the OpenSearch / Elasticsearch domain and then update it in the same way as you did for the initial setup (using CloudFormation or AWS CDK.) You can view the changelog of SIEM [here.](CHANGELOG.md)

> **_Note_: When you update SIEM, Global tenant settings, dashboards, etc. will be overwritten automatically. The configuration files and dashboards used before the update will be backed up to aes-siem-[AWS_Account]-snapshot/saved_objects/ in the S3 bucket, so restore them manually if you want to restore the original settings.**

> **_Note_: S3 bucket policy, KMS key policy, IAM policy, etc. are automatically generated by CDK/CloudFormation. Manual modification is not recommended, but if you have modified it, it will be overwritten, so please back up each and update the difference after updating. Or when updating CDK/CloudFormation, keep the current bucket policy by setting the parameter LogBucketPolicyUpdate to `keep`**

### Upgrading the OpenSearch Service domain

Upgrade the domain to OpenSearch 1.0 - 2.11 or Elasticsearch version 7.10. Some Dashboards assume OpenSearch Service 1.3 or higher. The recommended version is OpenSearch Service 2.11 with "Enable compatibility mode":

1. Navigate to the [OpenSearch Service console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/aos/home?)
1. Choose domain: [**aes-siem**]
1. Choose [**Actions**] icon, and choose [**Upgrade domain**] from the drop-down menu
1. For "Version to upgrade to", choose [**OpenSearch 2.11**] (Recommended), [**OpenSearch 1.0 - 2.9**], or [**Elasticsearch 7.10**]
1. Choose "Enable compatibility mode" (Recommended)
1. Then choose [**Submit**]

If you completed the initial setup using CloudFormation, move on to the next step. If you completed the initial setup using the AWS CDK, see  
"Updating SIEM with the AWS CDK" section in [Advanced Deployment](docs/deployment.md).

### Checking es-loader Layer (Configuration File) Version

The es-loader Lambda function currently specifies Python 3.11. The lambda layer for configuration file must be compatible with the same version. Check the [Compatible runtimes] of the relevant AWS Lambda layer and modify it to include the same version if it's not already included.

Reference: [Adding user.ini to an AWS Lambda layer (recommended)](docs/configure_siem.md#adding-userini-to-an-aws-lambda-layer-recommended)

### Updating the CloudFormation stack

You can update the CloudFormation stack by specifying the CloudFormation template. Please see [CloudFormation Templates for All Regions](docs/cloudformation_list.md) for template URLs.

1. Navigate to the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?)
1. Choose stack [**aes-siem**]
1. Choose [**Update**] at the right top on the screen
1. In Update stack, choose the following:
    * Prepare template: [**Replace current template**]
    * Template source: [**Amazon S3 URL**]
    * Amazon S3 URL:
    * Choose [**Next**]
1. Leave all the other settings as default, and continue to click Next to complete.

Updating is now complete.

## Changing Configurations

### Changing the OpenSearch Service domain resources after deployment

If you want to make changes to the OpenSearch Service domain itself such as changing the access policy of OpenSearch Service, changing the instance type, changing the Availability Zone or adding a new one, or changing to UltraWarm, perform the change from the [OpenSearch Service console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/aos/home?) of AWS Management Console.

### Managing the index and customizing SIEM

SIEM on OpenSearch Service saves logs in the index and rotates it once a month. If you want to change this interval or load logs from non-AWS services, see [this.](docs/configure_siem.md)

## Near-real-time logs loading from non-SIEM-managed S3 buckets

If you have an S3 bucket in the same account and region as the SIEM, you can load logs into OpenSearch Service. Please refer [Near-real-time loading from other S3 buckets](docs/configure_siem.md#near-real-time-loading-from-other-s3-buckets) for the setting method.

## Loading stored logs through batch processing

You can execute es-loader, which is a python script, in the local environment to load past logs stored in the S3 bucket into SIEM on OpenSearch Service. See [Loading past data stored in the S3 bucket](docs/configure_siem.md#loading-past-data-stored-in-the-s3-bucket) for details.

## Throttling of es-loader in an emergency

To avoid unnecessary invocation of es-loader, throttle es-loader under the following conditions

* If total free space for the OpenSearch Service cluster remains less than 200MB for 30 minutes and `aes-siem-TotalFreeStorageSpaceRemainsLowAlarm` is triggered.
  * The OpenSearch cluster is running out of storage space. More free space is needed for recovery. To learn more, see [Lack of available storage space](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/handling-errors.html#handling-errors-watermark).

If you want to resume loading logs, set the reserved concurrency of the Lambda function `aes-siem-es-loader` back to 10 from the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
You can also load messages from the dead-letter queue (aes-siem-dlq) by referring to [Loading data from SQS Dead Letter Queue](docs/configure_siem.md#loading-data-from-sqs-dead-letter-queue).

## Cleanup

1. Navigate to the CloudFormation console and delete stack: aes-siem
1. Delete the following AWS resources manually:
    * OpenSearch Service domain: aes-siem
    * Amazon S3 bucket: aes-siem-[AWS_Account]-log
    * Amazon S3 bucket: aes-siem-[AWS_Account]-snapshot
    * Amazon S3 bucket: aes-siem-[AWS_Account]-geo
    * AWS KMS customer-managed key: aes-siem-key
        * **Please delete this with care**. After deleting this customer-managed key, you will no longer be able to read logs if they are encrypted using this key.
1. If you deployed SIEM on OpenSearch Service within an Amazon VPC, delete the following AWS resources as well:
    * Amazon VPC: aes-siem/VpcAesSiem (if you created a new VPC)
    * SecurityGroup: aes-siem-vpc-sg

> **_Note_** If you want to redeploy SIEM on OpenSearch Service right after deleting it, you need to delete the key alias using the AWS CLI commands below. Otherwise, redeployment will fail as the KMS key alias still remains:

```shell
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<AWS_REGION>
aws kms delete-alias --alias-name  "alias/aes-siem-key"
```
